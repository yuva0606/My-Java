The question I have while i am solving the problems
1. methods of HashMap (https://www.javatpoint.com/java-hashmap)
2. How to iterate through HashMap (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/traverse-through-a-hashmap-in-java/)
3. Does HashMap Follows insertion order
   -> No, HashMap doesnt maintain insertion order, for that we should use "LinkedHashMap".
4. learned a new approach to solve problem efficently (Day3).
